                <div class="description">A lone cacao tree once stood amidst a forgotten battlefield. The flames of war provided it with light, and blades of steel nourished its roots. It was beneath this solitary tree where First Choco Cookie slowly opened her eyes for the first time. Wielding enchanted blades that respond to her commanding voice and to her alone, this merciless warrior can cut through legions of enemies with ruthless precision and speed, leaving none in her wake. Her strength alone is enough to pummel enemy strongholds into gravel and graves. Though her unflinching gaze and cold demeanor can send shivers down the spines of even the bravest Cookies, hidden beneath the cacao nib armor lies a sweet and tender heart.</div>

                <div class="description"> The castle's kitchen can become unnaturally chilly. After being exposed to such temperatures for a prolonged period, the highest quality milk separated itself to form a rich and flavored cream. This Cookie's dough contains a large portion of this special cream, but beyond her cultivated grace lies a cold and frigid glare. It's said that First Cream Cookie's demeanor became especially frigid after she lost something close to her heart. This Cookie has her own agenda, but no one has ever uncovered what it might be.</div>

                <div class="description"> Amidst a boundless field of wheat shimmering like a gold sea underneath, a humble and noble Cookie opened her eyes. As warm and generous as the autumn of earth, this Cookie soon became adored by all who met her. First Grain Cookie is especially attuned to the needs of the hungry, and she is never able to turn a blind eye to their plight. With a graceful wave of her Grainstalk Staff, young sprouts burst forth from even the most arid of soil, and with a second wave, they become crops filled with the promise of a bountiful harvest. In the presence of First Grain Cookie, no one has to live with the fear and misery of hunger ever again.
